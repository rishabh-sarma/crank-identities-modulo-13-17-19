The three folders above hold three Maple files each that contain codes for finding and proving partition crank identities modulo higher primes. These identities express elements of the p-dissection of the two variable partition crank generating function (variable z being replaced by the primitive p-th root  of unity) in terms of quotients of generalized eta products with cyclotomic coefficients. The identities appear in Section 5.2 of my paper "Transformation and symmetries for the Andrews–Garvan crank function Hardy–Ramanujan J. 47 (2024), 1–25". 

The codes implement an algorithm described in Section 7 of my rank symmetry paper with Frank Garvan "New symmetries for Dyson’s rank function, Ramanujan J. 65 (2024), 1883–1939" to prove the identities. In the crank symmetry paper, it is established that the elements of the p-dissections are weakly holomorphic modular forms of weight 1 on a certain congruence subgroup of the special linear group. The proof of the identities then primarily involve establishing the equality using the Valence formula and showing that the combination 
of quotients of generalized eta products also has the same modular structure. This is accomplished utilizing the algorithm.

Note : One needs to have a Maple license bought and installed first to run the Maple files. Thereafter, one needs to download and install the following packages from the home page of Frank Garvan
1. QSERIES
2. CRANK
3. ETA and
4. THETAIDS.
